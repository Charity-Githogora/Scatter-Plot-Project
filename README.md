# Doping in Professional Bicycle Racing

This project is a data visualization that explores doping allegations in professional cycling, showcasing the 35 fastest times up Alpe d'Huez. It uses data from [FreeCodeCamp's Cyclist Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/cyclist-data.json) to create an interactive scatterplot.

## Features
- **Interactive Scatterplot**: Hover over data points to view detailed information about each cyclist.
- **Doping Allegations Highlighted**: Cyclists with doping allegations are marked in red, and those without are marked in green.
- **Responsive Design**: The visualization adjusts to fit various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structuring the page content.
- **CSS**: Styling and adding visual appeal to the project.
- **JavaScript**: Fetching data and rendering the visualization.
- **D3.js**: Creating and managing the interactive scatterplot.
